# ChopShop Clicker Final Report

## Participants

Piotr Jackowski - Project code, initial concept idea, research on current available game types done by all by myself

Lorraine Hargrove - Play tested game throughout development, helped give ideas throughout development and thinking on the idea

## Abstract

I chose to create a phone based game. This game was meant to be a idling incremental game. It essentially a game that take minimal effort, so it can be played in short sessions. The player makes constant progress throughout playing, which can give it an almost addictive quality. Sometimes there even fun.

## Project narrative and Inspiration

All jokes aside this game his based off a lot of games. The most popular example I played is Cookie Clicker, which I played nonstop when it came out. Its simple concept with huge amounts of content with a constant growing curve to make the player take more and more work to climb a metaphorical ceiling which is usually connect to like a purchase that is completely out of your range. But eventually with time you will reach it.

A huge part of these games is that you can leave them off and when you come back the next day the game has progressed a little further. You now have enough money to buy the upgrade or research, so now you made that ceiling and completed your goal a new goal soon appears but now you make more than what you did before. This essentially continues along usually you reach a point you just cannot get past. At this point is when their is usually a shift in the game resetting all the progress but in return giving the player a bigger boost to get past that point.

There are a lot of these types of games on the market. Because of this I needed to differentiate my game to draw in different types of people and give a unique concept on the game. I realized I love my car, and love other cars. Soon after I looked to see if there was a game like this on the market. I soon found that there is no idle clicker game made that is related to cars, while not being basic. So after watching car movies like fast in the furious, and especially *John Wick*, which intrigued me with the chop shop scene. Since that day, which was a while back, I made a mental note to make a game like this in the future. In which, you are in charge of a **ChopShop** where you not only steal cars but also `Chop` the car parts of to sell for money.

At first I planed to make it a phone game but since, I was doing the project by myself and also wanted to learn how to code in python. So I decided I would make the concept of the game in **Pygame** to not only be able to learn from your instructions on game design but also learn on a more fundamental level of game design. That way when I one day build and design this game in *Unity* or *Unreal Engine*. I would not only know how to build and design games but also have a fully planned out concept to go off and create a more visually appealing product. I am not saying that you cannot make a good looking game in **Pygame** but unity does make it easier by doing some heavy lifting, while giving shortcuts to a lot of code.

Initial player goals were to be able to learn the rules and how the game is played. Luckily idle games tend to be a lot more simple then most games so it is quick to learn. Immediately, players are looking to steal more and more cars to make more money. Soon they want it to go faster then what they can produce so they look for other options. The player will start testing certain things and realize that they can hire people to do work for them. However, the workers are slow at first so soon the player also wants to improve his workers while improving other things to keep things progressing. Eventually, the player will notice things will take longer so they will probably start saving to reach a certain upgrade like a multiplier or any other good worker/upgrade that will improve, in some what shape or form, the income of the player. This pattern of constantly reaching new levels even to the point of numbers so big entices the player to keep on going.

## Outline

1) The initial Goal was to learn not only how to use **Pygame** but also **Python**.
   A) The first steps were to learn the syntax
   B) I need to learn how to make the game loops and where to place certain items and actions based on the loop to make changes to the game.
2) Learn how to create a button, which started with a very basic button
3) Create the buttons to know what game loops will be needed for the different types of screens
   1) Stealing - Meant to be a Map for stealing items.
   2) Inventory - Manage current part stocks for selling and possible future usage for upgrades.
   3) Research - For getting upgrades for the base and your income.
